# RescaleSTx
This is a package for rescaling coordinates for Visium 10x transcriptomics datasets. This enables the highest resolution (or an arbitrary resolution) of microscopy image to be used for STx analysis,  which enables advanced image processing and machine-learning using image features and coordinates of spatial transcriptomics datasets
